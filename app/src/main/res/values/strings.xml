        "Material is the metaphor.\n\n"

        "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion."
        "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet "
        "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n"
        "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The "
        "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the "
        "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical "
        "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n"
        "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, "
        "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows "
        "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n"

        "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between "
        "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "
        "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "
        "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"
        "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "
        "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a "
        "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"
        "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "
        "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB wonâ€™t interfere "
        "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"

    <!-- Chest -->
    <string name="barbell_bench_press">
        "Instructions:\n\n"
        "1. Lie back on a flat bench. Using a medium width grip, lift the bar from the rack and hold "
        "it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position.\n\n"
        "2. From the starting position, breathe in and begin coming down slowly until the bar "
        "touches your middle chest.\n\n"
        "3. After a brief pause, push the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out. Focus "
        "on pushing the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the "
        "contracted position at the top of the motion, hold for a second and then start coming down "
        "slowly again. Tip: Ideally, lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it.\n\n"
        "4.Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\n\n"
        "5. When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.\n\n"

    <string name="dumbbell_flyes">
        "Instructions:\n\n"
        "1. Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell on each hand resting on top of your thighs. "
        "The palms of your hand will be facing each other.\n\n"
        "2. Then using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells, lift the dumbbells one at a time "
        "so you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width with the palms of your hands "
        "facing each other. Raise the dumbbells up like you're pressing them but stop and hold "
        "just before you lock out. This will be your starting position.\n\n"
        "3. With a slight bend on your elbows to prevent stress at the biceps tendon, lower your "
        "arms out at both sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in "
        "as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Keep in mind that throughout the "
        "movement, the arms should remain stationary; the movement should only occur at the "
        "shoulder joint.\n\n"
        "4.	Return your arms back to the starting position as you squeeze your chest muscles and "
        "breathe out. Tip: Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights.\n\n"
        "5. Hold for a second at the contracted position and repeat the movement for the prescribed "
        "amount of repetitions.\n\n"

    <!-- Back -->
    <string name="wide_grip_lat_pulldown">
        "Instructions:\n\n"
        "1. Sit down on a pull-down machine with a wide bar attached to the top pulley. Make "
        "sure that you adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height. These pads will "
        "prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar.\n\n"
        "2. Grab the bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: "
        "For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than shoulder width. "
        "For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder "
        "width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width.\n\n"
        "3. As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip "
        "width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your "
        "lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position.\n\n"
        "4.	As you breathe out, bring the bar down until it touches your upper chest by drawing the "
        "shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles "
        "once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary and "
        "only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the bar; "
        "therefore, do not try to pull down the bar using the forearms.\n\n"
        "5. After a second at the contracted position squeezing your shoulder blades together, "
        "slowly raise the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and "
        "the lats are fully stretched. Inhale during this portion of the movement.\n\n"
        "6. Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\n\n"

        "3. Lean over as you keep the natural alignment of your back and grab the V-bar handles.\n\n"
        "4. With your arms extended pull back until your torso is at a 90-degree angle from "
        "your legs. Your back should be slightly arched, and your chest should be sticking out. You "
        "should be feeling a nice stretch on your lats as you hold the bar in front of you. This is "
        "the starting position of the exercise.\n\n"
        "5. Keeping the torso stationary, pull the handles back towards your torso while keeping "
        "the arms close to it until you touch the abdominals. Breathe out as you perform that "
        "movement. At that point you should be squeezing your back muscles hard. Hold that contraction "
